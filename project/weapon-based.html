<h1>Weapon-based Martial Arts</h1>
<p>Some martial arts revolves entirely around weapons. The type of weapon varies depending on the martial art. Techniques like punching or grappling are not allowed. 
But the same principles found in other martial arts are used in these martial arts.</p>
<h2>Kendo</h2>

<p>
Kendo is a modern-day Japanese martial art, based on traditional samurai swordsmanship. Kendo practitioners can perform lightning-quick attacks that can happen with 1/10 of a second! 
Practitioners must strike opponents with a bamboo sword (aka shinai) in one of four areas to score points.
</p>
<p> 
These areas are the men(head), kote(wrists), do(torso), and Tsuki (thrust to the throat).
If you hit one of these four areas faster than your opponent you are awarded 1 ippon (point). 
Kendo lasts for ten minutes and is the best of three ippon.

<p>
Iaido is a Japanse martial art focused on the drawing of the sword from its scabbard. 
Practitioners of this martial art will practice the "cut" of the sword. Iaido uses bokken(wooden sword), Iaito(unsharpen metal sword), or Shinken(sharpened metal sword). 
Iaido focuses on fluid and precise movement. Moreover, Iaido does not allow sparring.

</figure>
<p>
Naginatajutsu is a Japanse martial art focused on the Naginata. The naginata is a long pole that looks like a spear with a long curved blade at the top. 
A metal blade is not used today for safety reasons.
</p>
<p> 
There are two different kinds of competition in Naginata. 
Shiai-kyōgi is similar to the Kendo competition. Armour (bōgu) is worn and competitors engage in sanbon-shōbu. 
That is, the first to get two points within the designated time limit wins.
</p>
<p> 
The other type of competition is called engi-kyōgi. In this competition, a team of two is pitted against another pair. 
Both teams perform set-forms or techniques.
