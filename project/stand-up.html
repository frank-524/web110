<h1>Stand-up</h1>
<p>Stand-up or striking martial arts focuses on how to defend while standing. Techniques for stand-up martial arts include throwing punches, kicks, elbows, and blocking.
Some stand-up martial arts may use all of these techniques or some of them. There will be a more detailed explanation of each martial art below. But for now the main point is that stand up martial arts take place standing.

<h2>Boxing</h2>

<p>
Boxing is arguably one of the most popular stand-up martial arts in the world! Boxing involves attack and defense with fists. 
Boxers wear padding gloves to protect their fist and to block punches.
</p>
<p>
The main goal of boxing is to land punches that can knockout the opponent. 
This is easier said then done as boxers have to take punches and avoid them. If the boxer does not manage to knockout their opponent
then the decision goes to the judges who decides the winner of the fight. 
If you want to learn how to throw punches and avoid them boxing is the right pick for you!

Muay Thai or Thai boxing is the national sport of Thailand. Muay Thai is also known as the "art of eight limbs" because of the 8 potential points of combat (2 feet, 2 knees, 2 elbows, and 2 fists). 
Muay Thai allows punches, kicks, elbows, knees, standing grappling, and head-butts.
Because of this, there are many Muay Thai techniques to learn.
</p>
<p> 
A couple of Muay Thai techniques are teep (front kick), sok ti (striking elbow), and kao tone (straight knee). 
Likewise knowing how to defend leg kicks, elbows, knees, and clinching are essential!

Similar to boxing, Karate is a popular martial art and had a major cultural impact! The origin of Karate is complicated. 
Little is known about the origin of Karate. Theory suggests that it came from India over a thousand years ago.
</p>
<p> 
Karate allows kicks, striking, and defensive blocking with arms and legs. 
There is four main karate styles out there. The four main karate styles are Goju-ryu, Shotokan-ryu, Wado-ryu, and Shito-ryu. Each form is derived in some way from the karate established by Gichin Funakoshi.
</p>
<p> 
Unlike other martial arts, winning is not the main goal of karate. 
There is a ranking system but the main goal of karate is to develop a strong body and mind.
