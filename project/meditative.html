<h1>Meditative/low-impact</h1>
<p>
Low impact/meditative martial arts do not focus on combat. These martial arts focus on breathing techniques, fitness, and the spiritual side. 
Some of these martial arts will claim to help in self-defense. However, this is NOT TRUE! Baguazhang, Tai chi, and qigong do not help in self-defense.
</p>
<h2>Baguazhang</h2>

<p>
Baguazhang translates to "eight trigram palm". No one knows who created baguazhang. 
It is believed to be founded by a man named Don Hai Quan, who is said to have learned it from Daoist and Buddhist masters.
</p>
<p> 
Theories suggest that baguazhang existed in 19th century China.
Early training of baguazhang focuses on the mind. 
Afterward, training becomes about the movements and techniques of discipline. One of the most famous aspects of baguazhang is “circle walking”. 
This is a training tool where baguazhang practitioners walk around the edge of a circle while practicing their forms, stances and evasive circular footwork. 
The goal of baguazhang is to improve health.

<p> 
Tai Chi originated in China. Its origin dates back to 700 years. 
Tai Chi translates to "supreme ultimate fist" in mandarin. Ironically, tai chi is not meant for combat.
The techniques used in tai chi are not practical in a combat situation.
</p>
<p> 
Nonetheless, tai chi is practiced by millions of people globally. 
It is practiced by so many because of health and meditative benefits. 
Moreover, tai chi is low impact making it safe for all ages and fitness levels.

<h2>Qigong</h2>

	<figcaption>Qigong is like tai chi but more lenient.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Like tai chi, Qigong originated hundreds of years ago. Qi (or chi) is the "life force that permeates the universe and all living things". 
Gong refers to the working or gathering of qi. Tai chi also uses chi but has more of a martial arts background.
</p>
<p> 
Tai chi is more complex than qigong and requires good form. 
Meanwhile, qigong is more lenient than tai chi. Qigong can have just a few movements and hence is quite adaptable. 
The simple moves involved are easy to match to any level of physical ability. 
Qigong practitioners learn movements, breathing exercises, meditating, sound, self-massage, and focused intent.
