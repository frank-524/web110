<p>
There are many forms of wrestling out there. 
The four main styles of wrestling out there are folkstyle, freestyle, Greco-Roman, and catch wrestling. Each style of wrestling has a unique set of rules.
</p>
<p> 
We will focus on folkstyle wrestling. Folkstyle wrestling (aka scholastic wrestling) is a wrestling style you will see in a high school and college level.
Folkstyle focuses on takedowns on the feet; and controlled riding and turns while on top. Wrestlers can not lock hands unless it is a pinning combination or a takedown attempt. 
</p>
<p>
The goal of folkstyle wrestling is to pin your opponent using takedowns, throws, and pins. A pin is holding your opponent back for two seconds.
Folkstyle wrestling is perfect to learn how to takedown an opponent!

Jiu-Jitsu translates to gentle art. Catch wrestling is known as the violent art. Catch wrestling is a hybrid grappling style that allows wrestling and submission. 
In catch wrestling, there are no limits on how you can manipulate the body. 
</p>
<p>
Catch wrestling is a wrestling based background so it starts on the feet. 
Some Jiu-Jitsu classes frown upon and forbid the use of some techniques like spine locks, neck cranks, leglocks, and slams. These techniques are allowed in catch wrestling.
</p>
<p> 
Unfortunately, not many people know about catch wrestling because of the lack of structure and certified coaches.
