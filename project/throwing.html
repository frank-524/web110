<h1>Throwing</h1>
<p>
Throwing martial arts focuses on throwing the opponent on the floor using takedowns. 
A takedown is a technique that involves off-balancing an opponent and bringing the opponent to the floor. 
Grappling martial arts teaches takedowns and throws. 
So there is a overlap, some throwing martial arts also teach grappling. But the main focus of throwing martial arts are takedowns.

<p>
Judo descended from Japanese jujutsu. 
Judo teaches how to take an opponent to the ground using their momentum. 
Once the opponent is in the ground, the practitioner can achieve a dominant position or use a submission. 
But some techniques are not allowed in judo like grabbing the leg with your hands or attacking joints other than the elbow.
</p>
<p>
Judo's groundwork (newaza) has a unique set of rules different than BJJ. 
Many modern judo referees allow very little time for groundwork before standing the players up to restart the match standing.

<p>
Aikido is known as self-defense martial art. Morihei Ueshiba created aikido during the 1920s in Japan. 
Ueshiba wanted to control the aggressor's movement. Aikido uses throws, standing joint locks, and pins.
</p>
<p> 
Higher level students of aikido may use weapons and free sparring. This all sounds good until you realize the major flaw of aikido. 
The major flaw of aikido is its effectiveness. Most of the techniques used in aikido are ineffective in a real combat situation.

<p>
Hapkido was created by Choi Yong Sul a Korean. Hapkido translates to "The way of coordination and internal power."
Hapkido incorporates other techniques found in other martial arts. 
Punches, kicks, and grappling are allowed in Hapkido.
Hapkido also allows the use of weapons. 
</p>
<p>
Unlike aikido, hapkido has proven to be effective. 
With that being said, hapkido is meant for self-defense. But, like other martial arts sparring is allowed in hapkido.
In fact, hapkido sparring rules are based on Tae Kwon Do. Hapkido allows throwing and locking techniques not used in Tae Kwon Do.
