<h2>Soccer</h2>
<p> Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. In fact, billions of people tune in to watch the World Cup final!
The rule of the game is to use your feet to move the ball into your opponent's net. This sounds simple, but it requires alot of practice on and off the field.
Soccer can be played with a team or on a one-on-one game. However, it is better to play soccer with a group of friends or team.

<h2> Why I love Soccer </h2>
<p> My dad used to play soccer when he was younger. He would always tell me stories about his glory days. 
I enjoyed hearing his stories but I did not really like soccer or sports. That all changed in 2013 when my older cousin convinced me to play soccer.
My older cousin also recommended that I buy this game called "FIFA 13". My dad, cousin, and FIFA 13 are the reasons why I love soccer. 
To this day I still love soccer.
