	<ul>
		<li><strong>Personal background:</strong> I am the son of two hard-working immigrants from Mexico. I have a identical twin and a older sister. Born and raised in Charlotte. I have been here for all my life and I don't have any plans leaving yet. Went to Myers Park High School and now I am currently at CPCC. 
		</li>
		<li><strong>Professional background:</strong> My mom is a small-business owner. So I got my start working in her store. I started working since I was 16. While I was there, I worked as a cashier and a stocker. At some point I learned how to replace the screens of the IPhone 6. I worked there till 2018. The job got boring so I decided to work at Harris Teeter. Been at Harris Teeter for about 5 months.</li>
		<li><strong>Academic background:</strong> High School diploma. I just recently graduated from High School in 2019. 
		During High School I took some cpcc classes under a college and career program. That program helped me out a lot, and I finished all the general ed classes. Currently I am pursing a Applied Associates in Software Development. As of now, I have no plans on transferring to a four year college but that might change.</li>
		<li><strong>Background in the subject matter of this course</strong>: Started learning a little bit of HTML for fun in 2018. Granted I was not consistent with it, but it did help me understand more about how websites work. During high school I actually took CIS 110, CTI 110, CTI 120, CTI 130, and CTS 115. I enjoyed most of these classes except for CTI 120 and CTI 130. I took those classes online and they were terrible. </li>
		<li><strong>Primary computer platform:</strong> Windows 10 Hp Elitebook</li>
		<li><strong>Reason for taking each course: </strong>
		<ul>
		<li>WEB 110-01: Internet/Web Fundamentals- For starters, this class is under my Associates degree. Since I messed around with HTML a bit, creating websites doesn't look bad. I would like to learn how to do both the front end and back end. <a href = "contract.html">WEB110 Course Contract</a></li> 
		<li>CTS 240-50: Project management- Since I would like to become a software developer, managing projects is very important. Oh and it's under my associates degree.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:</strong> My friend had a dirt bike and one day I decided to go along for a ride. Being the knucklehead that he is, this guy went full speed into a ramp. When we were mid air, my butt was wayy off the seat. If it wasn't for me hugging him like a girl I would've been seriously hurt. Safe to say I don't plan on going for a ride with him any time soon...</li>
		<li><strong>I'd also like to share: </strong>l know how to speak some Spanish (Seriously I need to improve on it). I love soccer, MMA, and video games. I love listening to Rock, Rap, and Pop. Recently I got a electric guitar, hopefully, I will be good at it one day! </li>
